Steps of require in .js file

- Resolving: - To find the absolute file path of the module.
- Loading: - The content of the file at the resolved path.
- Wrapping: - Gives every module it's private scope and what makes require local to every module.
- Evaluating: - It is what the Virtual Machine (VM) does with the code.
- Caching: - It is done so that when we require the module again, we repeat all these steps.
